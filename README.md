# AIDL in Android Applications

This repository demonstrates the implementation of Android Interface Definition Language (AIDL) in regular Android applications. AIDL enables Inter-Process Communication (IPC) between different Android apps and services.

## üìù Overview

AIDL (Android Interface Definition Language) is a powerful tool in Android development that allows different applications to communicate with each other across process boundaries. This repository provides practical examples and implementations of AIDL interfaces in regular Android applications.
